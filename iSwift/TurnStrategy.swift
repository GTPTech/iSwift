// ðŸ’¡ Strategy
// -----------
// The strategy pattern is used to create an interchangeable
// family of algorithms from which the required process is 
// chosen at run-time.
// ---------------------------------------------------------


// Declare the behavior of the algorithm. This is defined in a protocol, 
// with one method. The method takes an array of the past turns in the game, 
// and returns the shape views to display for the next turn.

// Implement a basic strategy that uses a ShapeFactory and ShapeViewBuilder. 
// This strategy implements the existing behavior, where the shape views just 
// come from the single factory and builder as before. Notice how youâ€™re 
// using Dependency Injection again here, and that means this strategy doesnâ€™t 
// care which factory or builder itâ€™s using.
