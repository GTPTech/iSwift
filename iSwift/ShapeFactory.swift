// ðŸŒ° Abstract Factory
// -------------------
// The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with 
// a set of related or dependant objects. The "family" of objects 
// created by the factory are determined at run-time.

// ShapeFactory is a protocol to build in maximum flexibility, 
// just like in ShapeViewFactory.

  // in unit terms, for instance, in a range like [0, 1] â€” so you store this range.
